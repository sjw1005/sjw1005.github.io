<p class="center">Kuafu Raced With the Sun</p>
<p>Kuafu raced with the sun until it set. He was thirsty and wanted to drink water, so he went to the Yellow River and Weihe River to drink water.</p>
<p>There is not enough water in the Yellow River and Weihe River. Kuafu goes to the north to drink the water from the Great Lakes. </p>
<p>Before he reached the Great Lake, he died of thirst. Kuafu abandoned his cane, which turned into a peach forest.</p>
